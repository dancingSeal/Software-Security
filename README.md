# Software-Security
Module Eight Journal 

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
- Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates financial plans for their customers. The company wanted the the latest and most effective software security as they are planning to modernize their operations.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
-In this project, I was very though in analzing the found vulnerabilities and documented how to fix each issue. It is importantant to code securely to reduce security vulnerabilites to be compliant with regulations and protect customer information. Following security best standards contribute to a company's reliability and over all trust. 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
-At first there was a learning curve in understanding what I was supposed to be looking for. Google helped with understanding that to get rid of vulnerabilities it is best to upgrade to the latest dependency versions.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
-In this project, layers of security was established by following the Areas of Security Flow Chart. Input validation, APIs, Cryptography, code error, and code quality increase the layers of security. This flow chart should be considered in future projects to mitigate security vulnerabilities. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
-Not applicable for this porject

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
-mvnrepository.com was very helpful for finding latest versions that do not have known vulnerabilities

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
-I would be happy to show this project to future employers. It is complete and concise.
